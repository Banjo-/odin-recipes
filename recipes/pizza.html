    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups self-rising flour, or more as needed </li>
            <li>1 teaspoons white sugar></li>
            <li>2 tablespoons finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese </li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Mix 2 cups self-rising flour, sugar, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for dough in a bowl until well combined. Add olive oil and Greek yogurt and mix with a spoon until a shaggy dough forms. Clean off the spoon and mix the dough with your hands until it mostly comes together.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough to a work surface and continue pushing it together until it smooths out. It will be dry; don't be tempted yet to add more liquid. Knead dough until smooth and elastic, 3 to 4 minutes, only adding a teaspoon or two of water or flour if absolutely necessary. Cut dough into two equal pieces.</li>
            <li>Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and sprinkle 1 tablespoon cornmeal over the surface.</li>
            <li>Roll one piece dough on a lightly floured surface to an 1/8-inch-thick rectangle. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        </ol>
